Again, there are no data in your data folder. So I am unable to run your code. I can also see that this is not the complete code for chapter 4. 


Clear rs brain and add packages

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
```

Add compensation data into r and view it
```{r}
compensation <-read.csv(here("Data", "compensation.csv"))
View(compensation)
```
Make a scatterplot of the data
```{r}
ggplot(compensation, aes(x = Root, y = Fruit)) + geom_point()
```
